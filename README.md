### Hi there 👋

What's common between the beloved Harry Potter series 🪄 and everyone's favorite fast-food franchise KFC 🍗? 

It's that the writer J.K. Rowling and the businessman Colonel Sanders both experienced a lifetime of struggles and failures before they stumbled upon a golden goose with their respective projects. 

Their stories have been told and re-told billions of times to inspire our generation. But one thing I figured out very early from such stories is that hard work makes up a crucial trait of great women and men ✊, irrespective of the extent of their struggles or successes.

Hence, this naturally meant I had a predisposition to struggle and work hard in all my pursuits. It started at the beginning of my study life before reaching a peak during my undergraduate education 🤯.

During that period, I moved heaven and earth to manage several tasks. I was heading my college's sponsorship team, working as a volunteer for AIESEC, doing my internships, completing a project on IoT, and managing a job search, all while maintaining a decent GPA the whole time 😅.

But this inclination toward hard work didn't desert me even after I joined Accenture in 2019 as a newbie to the IT world. I was initially trained there in the BI/BW module of SAP and was later assigned to work for a support project in the capacity of an SAP SD consultant. It was a brilliant opportunity to make my mark, but there was only one problem 🤦‍♀️- BI/BW and SD modules were as different as chalk and cheese.

It didn't deter me 🧐. I did what I have been doing my whole life - going through a great struggle and coming off better at the other end. It helped me master SAP SD in a short duration, become an influential member of my team, achieve promotion within Accenture, and finally land a job offer with four great companies. Later, I chose to join International Business Machines Corporation, a company nicknamed the 'big blue' and probably best known by its abbreviation - IBM.

Another fun fact about me is that I am probably one of the few employees in history who received recognition from the companies while serving their notice periods. I was recognized with the Pinnacle Award by Accenture while I was in the middle of my notice period for assisting a client in resolving a critical business issue despite the end of my working hours. 

I am well-versed in the technologies like Python and SQL, which I have used multiple times while doing my internships and for completing my projects. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's at Oklahoma State University in the Business Analytics and Data Science program.
